What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It will create a repositary. In order to start committing hence creating different changes on each commit.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is an intermediate stage in order to keep commits small using one commit per logical change. Related files being altered should be added in this staging area.
